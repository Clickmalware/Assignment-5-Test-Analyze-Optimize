# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3

    if not numbers:
        raise TypeError("List must not be empty")
    if not all(isinstance(n, int) for n in numbers):
        raise TypeError("List must contain only integers")
    #initialize counter and find most common element
    counter = Counter(numbers)
    most_common, _ = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    return most_common
#run a test for the code above
print(most_frequent(numbers))  # Output: 3
